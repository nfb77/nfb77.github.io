# Nicholas (Nicc) Forster-Benson

**PhD Student, Sociology & Social Policy, Harvard University**

**Research Interests:** Knowledge production and policy, political economy, financialization and inequality, mixed methods

## About Me
Nicc will receive his BA in Economics and Quantitative Social Science from Vanderbilt
University in May of 2025. In his honors thesis, Nicc applied causal inference methods from econometrics,
taking advantage of a quasi-experimental policy design to estimate the effect of upzoning on housing
affordability in Nashville. Niccâ€™s findings demonstrated the regressive effects of upzoning on housing
affordability, relating upzoning policies to the peripheralization of black communities in Nashville. Analyzing
upzoning as a process of spatial financialization, his thesis draws upon the social production of space as a
framework to understand post-Fordist modes of accumulation in Nashville.

Nicc has worked under the mentorship of both Dr. Richard Lloyd (VU sociology) and Karim Nchare (VU
economics) navigating the complexities of formal economic modeling in relation to the socially-temporally
contingent nature of economic phenomenon. In another strand of research, Nicc has applied insights into the
social construction of political economy to topics of international development and legacies of colonialism in
Africa, analyzing trade relationships between Portugal and its former African colonies from 1960-2022. Using
gravity model Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood estimates of bilateral trade flows, Niccâ€™s research provided [quantitative evidence for the persistence of colonial commodity dependence](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4874987) and natural resource
exploitation. His work combined empirical methodology with world-systems theory aiming to enhance our
understanding of Africaâ€™s unequal exchange in the new global division of labor, emphasizing the socio-political
construction of modern economic inequalities.

With experience working for the Tennessee Department of Treasury, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board of
Governors, and running for political office in Tennessee, Nicc aims to continue exploring the relations between
state agents, knowledge production, and governance in graduate school. Currently, he is interested in
examining how the logics of financialization and globalization shape inequality, permeating housing,
infrastructure, and public space. Exploring the socio-political dynamics of contemporary urban governance
Nicc looks to investigate the evolving relationships between cities, markets, and policy.
Raised and educated in Nashville Tennessee, Nicc has also lived in Boston, Chicago, Milan, and Uppsala
Sweden. In his spare time, Nicc is a pick-up basketball enthusiast and part time 3-point specialist.
